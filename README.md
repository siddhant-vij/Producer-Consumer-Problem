# Producer Consumer Problem

Aims to implement and analyze the producer-consumer problem, a fundamental concept in concurrent programming, across multiple programming languages. This project will demonstrate how to efficiently manage the production and consumption of data using threads or processes, with a focus on synchronization, communication, and avoiding deadlocks.
<br>
<br>
By comparing implementations in Java, C++, Go, and Python, the project will provide insights into the concurrency models of each language and their practical applications in solving common synchronization challenges.

## Features

- Concurrent production and consumption of data items.
- Thread-safe communication between producers and consumers.
- Support for multiple producers and consumers.
- Mechanisms to gracefully terminate the process once all data is processed.
- Performance metrics and analysis of each implementation.
- Multi-language support with implementations in Java, C++, Go, and Python.

<br>

## Technical Scope

- **Java**: Using BlockingQueue for thread-safe data exchange between producers and consumers.
- **C++**: Employing condition variables and mutexes to synchronize access to a shared buffer.
- **Go**: Leveraging channels and goroutines for idiomatic concurrency patterns.
- **Python**: Utilizing queue.Queue for thread-based implementations or multiprocessing.Queue for process-based scenarios.
